## Package organization

- Separate parameter estimation from model comparison

- Provide function of model comparison using both:

    - Likelihood of correlations, as in Goswami 2016
    - Likelihood of individuals, using a MVN distribution (include warnings for number of parameters)
    
- Caculate errors of module coeficients using bootstrap and/or Baysean matrix posterior samples

- Separate module coeficients from hypothetical matrix output (print method?)

- Print expected within module correlations? (probably no)

- Add option for restricting only some modules to positive correlations (as oposed to all, or none, as is the case now)

##Documentation

- z-transform and correlation scale discussion (correlations can't be added)
